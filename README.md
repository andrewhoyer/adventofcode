This is a collection of my solutions to Advent of Code puzzles.

Advent of Code is an annual coding puzzle challenge that runs from Dec 1 to Dec 25, with each day having a two-part problem to solve. Stars are awarded for each solution, and there are leaderboards for points and solve times.

## Tips

Here are a couple of suggestions I have based on experience, and what I've learned from others.

- If you intend to complete the challenge within the month, be sure to start on the puzzles early, and always complete them each day. Falling behind is very difficult to recover from.
- There is no actual time limit. In fact, you can also complete any of the past year's puzzles at any time.
- It's a good idea to do both parts of the puzzle each day if that is your goal. Howevever, don't get stuck on one for too long, especially Part 2. Keep moving ahead, and come back to the one you can't solve later for another try.
- The closer you get to Christmas, the busier things seem to get. Plan ahead to give yourself enough time. If you look at the stats, you'll find that only about 10% of people complete the final day compared to the first day.
