# Advent of Code

This is a collection of my solutions to Advent of Code puzzles.

Advent of Code is an annual coding puzzle challenge that runs from Dec 1 to Dec 25, with each day having a two-part problem to solve. Stars are awarded for each solution, and there are leaderboards for points based on solve times.
