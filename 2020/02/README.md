# Day 2

Using the input data, determine how many passwords are valid. In the data, the first column shows the minimum and maximum number of times the character should appear in the password. The second column gives the character, and the third column is the password.

```
$ python3 02.py
```

## Part 2

Do the same as Part 1, where the first and second numbers correspond to the position of the character in the password (1 being the first character). 

The password must match EXACTLY one of the listed positions in the password.

The answer is the number of valid passwords.
