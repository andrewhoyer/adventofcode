# Day 14

This puzzle involves conversion of decimal and binary numbers, and the use of masking to generate values.

```
$ python3 14.py
```

## Part 2

The second part of this puzzle presents an interesting problem, where multiple memory addresses can be generated after the masking rules are applied. One way to solve it is to use a recurring function, which is what I did here. I'd be interested in finding out what other methods developers used, and if there are linear alternatives.

```
$ python3 14-b.py
```
