# Day 16

This was a low point for me in this series. All of the previous puzzles have been entertaining, and this one just felt like work. No doubt puzzles like this help narrow the field for people who want to 100% the series, and those who complete it are very deserving, especially ones who do it in record time.

Previously, the only puzzle I have missed is Day 13 Part 2. In that case, I came up with a partial solution that works with sample data but not the puzzle input. In this case, I'm skipping Part 2 because I don't have the time and feel there is low ROI to completing it.
