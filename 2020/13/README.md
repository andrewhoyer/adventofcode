```
$ python3 13.py
```

## Part 2

This solution to Part 2 is incomplete. It solves the problem for the simpler examples (see input-data2.txt and input-data3.txt) but for the actual input data which is much larger, it takes too long to be considered a solution, and I wasn't able to get the correct answer.

```
$ python3 13-b.py
